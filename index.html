            <h1>My Roller Skating Journey</h1>
            <h2>A Tale As Old As Grind</h2>
            <img src="DSC_0560.jpg" alt="Roller Skate Posing" id="horizonal" width="50%" height="50%">    
            <p id="inspiration" class="DarkMagenta">It seems dramatic to say that some Instagram story changed everything, but in this case, it's pretty much true. 
                I had never even heard of the term "jam skate" and had certainly never seen anything quite like what I was watching. 
                It was dance on wheels and I was hooked.
                The obligatory rabbit hole followed of course, video after video, tutorials, outtakes, and compilations, oh my!
                I, of course, soon broke out my hard-shell roller blades, circa 2000, just to see if I still had anything in me from my 10-year-old summertime driveway romps.
            </p>

            <h2>That First Time</h2>
            <p id="firstTime" class="Indigo">It was NOT PRETTY, y'all!
                I ate it. I fell, I scared myself.
                BUT some familiar feelings came out during that first roll.
                Not only did I feel certain muscles and sensations awaken and remember how to make my body move certain ways, but a deeper familiarty came over me, too.
                A creeping feeling of joy, and more than joy, <em>release.</em>
                I knew this wasn't going to be a one time thing.
            </p>

            <h2>Practice Makes...Well</h2>
            <p id="practice" class="DarkMagenta">I took those old blades out onto an outdoor rink one night later in the week with a friend.
                She had also just picked up skating and was probably happy to have company who couldn't judge her...<b>because I was worse.</b>
                Again, I fell a few times; scared myself more times.
                But I picked up on something <b>really</b> important (besides how to stop).
                <br><br>
                <em>You CANNOT be afraid of falling.</em>
            </p>
            <br><br><br>
            <img src="DSC_0593.jpg" alt="Stop For a Photo" width="50%" height="50%">
            <h2>Rolling Forward. And Backward, too!</h2>
            <p id="gettingBetter" class="Indigo">Once I embraced the idea that I was definitely going to fall, but that it would be ok, I was really able to move forward and learn new skills.
                I tried skating on one foot, I tried skating backwards, I tried jumping.
                I bought my own pair of brand new purple roller skates from the local skate shop, <a href="www.legacyskateskc.com">Legacy Skates</a>, and kept on rolling.
                I skate at least a few times a week, between Adult Nights at old school rinks, to late nights at outdoor parks, to the street outside my house.
                I even bring my skates to my work on nights I close and break them out after everyone else has left!
                <br>
                I swear, <em>nothing</em> beats seeing the faces of observers light up as I pass. 
                And not because I look cool, or I have neat tricks. Because I am certainly not there yet.
                But I think because there's a spark of a memory, maybe a summertime driveway, somewhere with them too.

        <article id="callToAction">If this interested you, like, AT ALL, maybe piqued some curiosity, or brought on a memory, I can't encourage you enough to just TRY IT!
            Grab your old pair of skates, or use the rentals at the rink, and just give it a shot!
            The best part is that you don't have to be good to enjoy it!
